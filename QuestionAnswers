Should I unlock characters using character fragments or wait until an event?
• Some characters you are forced to use character fragments.
• I would say anything with aptitude 13 or lower, you can wait until an event or you are given that character. It can save you 50 character fragments.

Why are some teams not complete? Where are Ramon and Seth?
• Good question. Too bad they are making bosses instead.

Are they going to rematch teams since they are adding teams from the sequels? For example, the edit team consist of Eiji, Kasumi and Shingo. Can they move it where Eiji, Kasumi and add Malin to make the anti-AOF team. Move Shingo with Lin and Jhun to make the Male Triple Alliance from KOF02um.
• This is an excellent suggestion

Are they gonig to make the Mirage Challenge daily instead of every other day?
• Good question since they have over 18 teams already. It would make it easier to obtain character fragments
