<h1>KOF98 umol Questions & Answers</h1>

<ol>
  <li>Should I unlock characters using character fragments or wait until an event?</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Some characters you are forced to use character fragments.</li>
    <li>I would say anything with aptitude 13 or lower, you can wait until an event or you are given that character. It can save you 50 character fragments.</li>
    <li>You can always recruit them if you have X amount of character fragments to recruit your character if you are bored or tired of waiting.</li>
    </ul>
  
  <li>Why are some teams not complete? Where are Ramon and Seth?</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Good question. Too bad they are making bosses instead.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <li>Are they going to rematch teams since they are adding teams from the sequels? For example, the edit team consist of Eiji, Kasumi and Shingo. Can they move it where Eiji, Kasumi and add Malin to make the anti-AOF team. Move Shingo with Lin and Jhun to make the Male Triple Alliance from KOF02um.</li>
    <ul>
      <li>This is an excellent suggestion. I do not think the developer has caught on to this or see this as a benefit.</li>
    </ul>
  
  <li>Are they gonig to make the Mirage Challenge daily instead of every other day?</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Good question since they have over 18 teams already. It would make it easier to obtain character fragments.</li>
    </ul>
  
  <li>Are they going to update the stores to reflect changes in characters? I am tired of seeing some aptitude 13 characters cost 2,000 currency for 5 fragments.</li>
    <ul>
      <li>I feel the same way. I am doubtful since it is less work for the developer.</li>
      <li>I do not know how this will benefit the developer in any way other than keeping older players.</li>
    </ul>
  
  <li>Are there unconventional ways to obtain characters to your roster?</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Yes, there are 2 ways off the top of my head.</li>
    <li>First, is when you first start and login. I think it is 9 days.</li>
    <li>Second, is when you take a leave for about a month. It is a player returning event.</li>
    <li>I did the second choice because of I got tired of grinding. I got better things to do with my time such as studying for AWS certifications and learning new skills.</li>
  </ul>
