## Questions and Answers

1. Should I unlock characters using character fragments or wait until an event?
- Some characters are easier to find such as Aptitude 11 and 12 characters. If you find an opportuntity to unlock characters by event such as Lucky Draw and/or Ultimtate, then I suggest you do the event.  You get a free character every 9 days of login to the bar. After a while of the bar, you might as well use the character fragments. I did that for Heavy D and Clark Steele.

2. Why are some teams not complete? Where are Ramon and Seth?
- At the beginning, I believe the project was intended for just the 98 cast. Later on, they saw the business being better and need to grab more customers. hence, their answer is to add boss stat characters to attract new and old players. I think they are adding characters based on popularity rather than completing teams.

3. Are they going to rematch teams since they are adding teams from the sequels? For example, the edit team consist of Eiji, Kasumi and Shingo. Can they move it where Eiji, Kasumi and add Malin to make the anti-AOF team. Move Shingo with Lin and Jhun to make the Male Triple Alliance from KOF02um.
- That is an excellent suggestion. I would do it since they are adding characters from different games as well.

4. Is the Mirage Challenge going to be daily rather than every other day?
- I wish they did. Easy way to gain character fragments.

5. Where should I spend my diamonds?
- In my experience, you need a certain amount for one-arm bandit. 
- Limited Boss events are good as well. You get a small amount of diamonds and spending X amount of diamonds will get you fragments of that character in the limited event.
