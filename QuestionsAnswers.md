# Questions and Answers

1. Should I unlock characters using character fragments or wait until an event?
- Some characters are easier to find such as Aptitude 11 and 12 characters. If you find an opportuntity to unlock characters by event such as Lucky Draw and/or Ultimtate, then I suggest you do the event you can.

2. Why are some teams not complete? Where are Ramon and Seth?
- At the beginning, I believe the project was intended for just the 98 cast. Later on, they saw the business being better and need to grab more customers. hence, their answer is to add boss stat characters to attract new and old players. I think they are adding characters based on popularity rather than completing teams.
